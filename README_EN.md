## 💭 Why Build Your Own?

Honestly, there are quite a few Claude proxy services online now, but there are also many issues:

### Problems with Existing Proxies

- 🕵️ **Privacy Risk**: Your conversation content is seen clearly by others, forget about business secrets
- 🐌 **Performance Instability**: Slow when many people use it, often crashes during peak hours
- 💰 **Price Opacity**: Don't know the actual costs

### Benefits of Self-hosting

- 🔐 **Data Security**: All API requests only go through your own server, direct connection to Anthropic API
- ⚡ **Controllable Performance**: Only a few of you using it, as fast as you want
- 💰 **Cost Transparency**: Clear view of how many tokens used, specific costs calculated at official prices
- 📊 **Complete Monitoring**: Usage statistics, cost analysis, performance monitoring all available

---

## 🚀 Core Features

### Basic Features
- ✅ **Multi-account Management**: Add multiple Claude accounts for automatic rotation
- ✅ **Custom API Keys**: Assign independent keys to each person
- ✅ **Usage Statistics**: Detailed records of how many tokens each person used

### Advanced Features
- 🔄 **Smart Switching**: Automatically switch to next account when one has issues
- 🚀 **Performance Optimization**: Connection pooling, caching to reduce latency
- 📊 **Monitoring Dashboard**: Web interface to view all data

## 📋 Deployment Requirements

### Hardware Requirements (Minimum Configuration)
- **CPU**: 1 core is enough
- **Memory**: 512MB (1GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 30GB available space
- **Network**: Access to Anthropic API (recommend US region servers)
- **Suggestion**: 2 cores 4GB is basically enough, choose network with good return routes to your country (to improve speed, recommend not using proxy or setting server IP for direct connection)

### Software Requirements
- **Node.js** 18 or higher
- **Redis** 6 or higher
- **Operating System**: Linux recommended

### Cost Estimation
- **Server**: Light cloud server, 10-30 RMB per month
- **Claude Subscription**: Depends on how you share costs

## 🐳 Simplest Deployment Method (Docker)

If you're too lazy to set up the environment, use Docker directly:

```bash
# 1. Download project
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-relay-service.git
cd claude-relay-service

# 2. One-click start
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Check if started successfully
docker-compose ps
```

That simple, the service is running.

## 📦 Manual Deployment (For Tinkerers)

### Step 1: Environment Setup

**Ubuntu/Debian users:**
```bash
# Install Node.js
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Install Redis
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server
```

**CentOS/RHEL users:**
```bash
# Install Node.js
curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo bash -
sudo yum install -y nodejs

# Install Redis
sudo yum install redis
sudo systemctl start redis
```

### Step 2: Download and Configure

```bash
# Download project
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-relay-service.git
cd claude-relay-service

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy configuration files (Important!)
cp config/config.example.js config/config.js
cp .env.example .env
```

### Step 3: Configuration File Setup

**Edit `.env` file:**
```bash
# Generate these two keys randomly, but remember them
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key
ENCRYPTION_KEY=32-character-encryption-key-write-randomly

# Redis configuration
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=
```

**Edit `config/config.js` file:**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  server: {
    port: 3000,          // Service port, can be changed
    host: '0.0.0.0'     // Don't change
  },
  redis: {
    host: '127.0.0.1',  // Redis address
    port: 6379          // Redis port
  },
  // Keep other configurations as default
}
```

### Step 4: Start Service

```bash
# Initialize
npm run setup

# Start service
npm run service:start:daemon   # Run in background (recommended)

# Check status
npm run service:status
```

---

## 🎮 Getting Started

### 1. Open Management Interface

Browser visit: `http://your-server-IP:3000/web`

Default admin account: admin / admin123

### 2. Add Claude Account

This step is quite important, requires OAuth authorization:

1. Click "Claude Accounts" tab
2. If you're in China, configure proxy first (Important!)
3. Click "Add Account"
4. Click "Generate Authorization Link", will open a new page
5. Complete Claude login and authorization in the new page
6. Copy the returned Authorization Code
7. Paste to page to complete addition

**Note**: If you're in China, this step may require VPN.

### 3. Create API Key

Assign a key to each user:

1. Click "API Keys" tab
2. Click "Create New Key"
3. Give the key a name, like "Zhang San's Key"
4. Set usage limits (optional)
5. Save, note down the generated key

### 4. Start Using API

Now you can replace the official API with your own service:

**Original request:**
```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: official-key" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-3-sonnet-20240229","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

**Current request:**
```bash
curl http://your-domain:3000/api/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: cr_your-created-key" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-3-sonnet-20240229","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

Just change the domain and API Key to your own generated one, everything else is the same.

## 🔧 Daily Maintenance

### Service Management

```bash
# Check service status
npm run service:status

# View logs
npm run service:logs

# Restart service
npm run service:restart:daemon

# Stop service
npm run service:stop
```

### Monitor Usage

- **Web Interface**: `http://your-domain:3000/web` - View usage statistics
- **Health Check**: `http://your-domain:3000/health` - Confirm service is normal
- **Log Files**: Various log files in `logs/` directory

### Common Issue Resolution

**Can't connect to Redis?**
```bash
# Check if Redis is running
redis-cli ping

# Should return PONG
```

**OAuth authorization failed?**
- Check if proxy settings are correct
- Ensure normal access to claude.ai
- Clear browser cache and retry

**API request failed?**
- Check if API Key is correct
- View log files for error information
- Confirm Claude account status is normal

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Setting Up Proxy (Must-read for Chinese Users)

If you're in China, you need to configure proxy to use normally:

```javascript
// Add in account configuration
{
  "proxy": {
    "type": "socks5",           // or "http"
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 1080,
    "username": "username",      // if proxy requires authentication
    "password": "password"       // if proxy requires authentication
  }
}
```

### Command Line Management Tool

Too lazy to open webpage? Use command line:

```bash
# View all API Keys
npm run cli keys list

# Create new Key
npm run cli keys create --name "Test Key" --limit 1000

# View account status
npm run cli accounts list

# Test account connection
npm run cli accounts test --id account-ID
```

### Monitoring Integration

If you want more professional monitoring, you can integrate Prometheus:

Visit `http://your-domain(or-IP):3000/metrics` to get metrics data.

## 💡 Usage Recommendations

### Account Management
- **Multiple Accounts**: Recommend adding 2-3 Claude accounts to prevent single point of failure
- **Regular Checks**: Check account status weekly, handle exceptions promptly
- **Backup Plan**: Prepare several backup accounts that can step in during critical moments

### Cost Control
- **Set Limits**: Set reasonable usage limits for each API Key
- **Monitor Spending**: Regularly check cost statistics, control budget
- **Reasonable Allocation**: Allocate quotas based on usage frequency

### Security Recommendations
- **Regular Backups**: Back up important configurations and data
- **Monitor Logs**: Regularly check exception logs
- **Update Keys**: Regularly change JWT and encryption keys

---

## 🆘 What to Do When You Encounter Problems?

### Self-troubleshooting
1. **Check Logs**: Log files in `logs/` directory
2. **Check Configuration**: Confirm configuration files are set correctly
3. **Test Connectivity**: Use curl to test if API is normal
4. **Restart Service**: Sometimes restarting fixes it

### Seeking Help
- **GitHub Issues**: Submit detailed error information
- **Read Documentation**: Carefully read error messages and documentation
- **Community Discussion**: See if others have encountered similar problems
